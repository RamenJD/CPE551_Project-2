## CPE551_Project-2
# CAPTAIN VEGGIE
### We will be developing the game Captain Veggie in this project. The good captain's land has been occupied by rabbits, and he must gather up as many of the veggies as can be collected before the leporine threat consumes everything entirely. Captain Veggie will have the ability to able to move about the field in the game and attempt to gather veggies by getting on top of them. Points are awarded to the captain for each vegetable harvested. 
#### The rabbits should be consuming any veggies they chance to land on while simultaneously hopping freely at the same time. 
#### The snake in the field will wander around, but it won't venture into a spot where a vegetable or a rabbit is situated. The snakeÂ will be making an effort to get to the captain's location. The captain loses the last five veggies put to their basket and the snake is reset to a new, random, unoccupied spot on the field if the snake ever manages to get into the same location as the captain. 
#### The player's score will be displayed on the screen whenever the game continues on until all the harvested vegetables are completely removed from the field.
